# Laboratory_Activity_Linear_Data_Structures


This Java program I made is a menu-driven console application that allows the user to interact with different data structures such as a stack, queue, linked list, and a circular linked list (though the circular list part is not yet implemented). 

At the start, the program declares these structures using Javaâ€™s built-in classes like Stack and LinkedList. It then continuously displays a main menu, asking the user which data structure they want to use. If the user chooses the stack, they can perform operations like push, pop, and display, which follow the Last-In-First-Out principle. 

If the queue is selected, the user can enqueue, dequeue, and display elements, demonstrating the First-In-First-Out concept. 

For the linked list, the options include inserting at the end, deleting at the beginning, and displaying all nodes, although this part is incomplete in the given code. 

The circular linked list is declared but does not yet have any operations defined. Overall, the program is designed as an interactive way to learn and practice basic data structure operations through user input.
